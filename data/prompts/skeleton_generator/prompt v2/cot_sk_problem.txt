Information about the problem is given as a pddl problem.
It includes the following information:
- objects: all the objects in the world. They should be of a type defined in the domain knowledge. For example, "parallel_box1" is an instance of the type "tool", while "gear1" is an instance of the type "part".
- init: the constraint relations in the world, described with [PREDICATE_LIST] from domain knowledge. They cannot be changed by robot actions.
- goal: IGNORE this and follow user's instructions instead.
An example:
"""
