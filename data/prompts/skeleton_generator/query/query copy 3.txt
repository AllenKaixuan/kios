The dictionary that you return should be formatted as json file. Follow these rules:
1. Always equip the proper tools before performing specific object manipulaion.
2. Refer to the "ROBOT ACTION LIST" to understand the elements of ["action_sequence"].
3. Never left ',' at the end of the list. Use json boolean values, "true" or "false", instead of "True" or "False".
4. Keep track of all the objects, constraints and relations in the "world_state" field.
5. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
6. Return the json dictionary without adding anything at the beginning and the end of it. You return should be ready to be parsed as a json object directly.
7. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation as a single arm robot.
8. When generating the behavior tree, make sure the tree has the asked structure. 
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the rules above. Think step by step.
