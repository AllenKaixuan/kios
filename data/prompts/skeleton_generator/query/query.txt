The dictionary that you return should be formatted as json file. Follow these rules:
1. Always equip the proper tools before performing specific object manipulaion.
2. Refer to the "ROBOT ACTION LIST" to understand the elements of ["action_sequence"].
3. Never left ',' at the end of the list. Use json boolean values, "true" or "false", instead of "True" or "False".
4. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
5. Your return should be ready to be parsed as a json object directly.
6. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation as a single arm robot.
7. Make sure the behavior tree has the asked structure.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the rules above. Think step by step.
