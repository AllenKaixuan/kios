Information about the objects is given as a dictionary. Its keys are the types and the values are lists of instances of that type. 
An example:
"""
{
  "fruit": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"],
  "part": ["gear", "nut", "bolt"],
  "tool": ["tool_box", "gripper", "screwdriver"]
}
"""
The types are defined and used in domain knowledge. 
Refer to the domain knowledge to understand which predicates and actions are applicable to which types.
