The input are:
last_behavior_tree: the last executed behavior tree.
user_feedback: the feedback from the user to help you improve the bahavior tree.
action_sequence: the action_sequence to assist you in behavior tree generation.

You analyze the failure reason of the last_behavior_tree with the help of user_feedback, then fix the behavior tree.
If no last_behavior_tree is given, you generate a behavior tree according to the action sequence. The behavior tree should follow the regulated format.
You only return the behavior tree as a json object that is ready to be parsed.
