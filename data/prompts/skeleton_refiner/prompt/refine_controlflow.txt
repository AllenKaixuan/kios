For each node, you should: 
- add an identifier field to the node, which is a unique integer number.
- add a type_name field to the node, which is a string that represents the type of the node.

For control flow nodes, namely selectors and sequences, an example is shown as follows:
the skeleton:
"""
{
    "summary": "selector to load no_tool to hand",
    "name": "selector: load_tool(left_hand, no_tool)",
    "children": [...],
}

"""
after refinement:
"""
{
    "summary": "selector to load no_tool to hand",
    "name": "selector: load_tool(left_hand, no_tool)",
    "identifier": 3,
    "type_name": "selector",
    "children": [...],
}
"""
