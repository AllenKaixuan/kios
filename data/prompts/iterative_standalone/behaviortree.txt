The behavior tree should be in json dictionary format.
1. Every node are described by a summary and a name:
    - "summary": a short interpretive description of the node. 
    - "name": includes the node type and the formal form of the node according to the domain knowledge. Legal node types are "selector", "sequence", "condition" ("target", "precondition"), "action".
2. The control flow nodes, namely "selector" and "sequence", can have "children", which is a list of children nodes.
3. The "condition" nodes that are children of "selectors" are targets. Those that are children of "sequences" are preconditions.
4. All the node should always have their corresponding actions/precidates in the domain knowledge.
5. Control flow nodes in behavior trees don't have memory. Each tick starts from the root and traverses all nodes, regardless of their previous state.
6. The basic structure template of a unit subtree is:
    - A selector as the root node. 
    - One target condition node as the first child of the selector to check if the target of this subtree has been satisfied.
    - A sequence node as the last child of the selector node to achieve the target condition node.
    - A number of precondition nodes as the first child nodes of the sequence node to check the action's preconditions.
    - One action node as the last child of the sequence node, whose preconditions are checked in the child condition nodes before.
    - The action should have effects that can fulfill the target condition node in the selector.

7. If any precondition node will be unsatisfied when it is ticked, a unit subtree should be constructed to replace it, which take that precondition node as its target node and aims to achieve it. You should estimate the world state when the precondition is ticked (checked) according to the initial state and the effects of the actions executed before, then do this replacement repeatedly until all the preconditions are satisfied at the time they are ticked.  
8. The behavior tree should be constructed based on the action sequence you planned and the action definitions in ROBOT_ACTION_LIST.
9. Control flow nodes (sequence nodes and selector nodes) don't have memory. Each tick starts from the root and traverses all nodes, regardless of their previous state.
