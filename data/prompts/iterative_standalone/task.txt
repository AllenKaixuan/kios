The input are:
target: The target that you make the sequential plan and construct the behavior tree to achieve.
initial_state: The initial state that you start from.
runtime_world_state: the world state when the last behaior tree stopped.
last_behavior_tree: the last executed behavior tree.
last_failed_node: the last node that failed in the last behavior tree.

You analyze the failure reason based on the information of the failed node and the runtime world state when the behavior tree failed, then fix the behavior tree.
If no last_behavior_tree is given, you analyze the target, refer to the domain knowledge to understand it, make an action sequence and construct a behavior tree based on it.
Learn from the examples to understand the regulated format of the behavior tree.
Your output should be a json object which follows the regulated format.
