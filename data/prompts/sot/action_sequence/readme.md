what is the proper way to assemble a tree?

the structure itself is a problem. though you have the unit trees and the action sequence, I still don't think it is a good idea to adopt the action sequence itself as the skeleton of the tree. It doesn't show a tree strucuture, and it does not present the dependency explicitly.

In json format the following is an attempt.
```json
{
    "actions": 
    [
        {
            "name": "change_tool(hand, tool1, tool2)",
            "preconditions_and_related_actions": 
            {
                "hold(hand, tool1)": null,
                "empty(tool1)": null
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "pick_up(hand, tool2, p1)",
            "preconditions_and_related_actions":
            {
                "hold(hand, tool2)": "change_tool(hand, tool1, tool2)",
                "empty(tool2)": null
            } 
        },
        {
            "name": "insert(hand, tool2, p1, p2)",
            "preconditions_and_related_actions": 
            {
                "hold(hand, tool2)": "change_tool(hand, tool1, tool2)",
                "hold(tool, p1)": "pick_up(hand, tool, p1)"
            }
        },
    ]
}
```
maybe it is a good idea to import causal graph to present this dependency and refine it later... ?

Let's try this json format first.
