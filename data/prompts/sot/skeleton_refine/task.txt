The input are:
explanation: the explanation of the action sequence.
action_sequence: the action sequence that was planned.
unit_trees: the corresponding unit trees of the actions in the action sequence.

You assemble the unit trees into an entire tree based on the action sequence and the explanation. You return the result tree as a json object.

You only output an json object, which is ready to be parsed directly. Any other superfluous output is forbidden.
