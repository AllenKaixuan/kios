INPUT:
action_sequence: 
[
    "change_tool(hand, tool1, tool2)",
    "pick_up(hand, tool2, p1)",
    "insert(hand, tool2, p1, p2)"
]
explanation: "after change_tool being executed, hand will hold tool2, which allows pick_up to be excuted. After pick_up, tool2 will hold p1, which allows insert to be executed."
