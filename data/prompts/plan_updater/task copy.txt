You are provided with:
- a user instruction
- an original robotic assembly plan made based on the user instruction.
- the current world state
- the steps in the original plan that have been executed and their result.

You update the original plan, remove the unnecessary steps if their targets have been achieved,
and add the steps that still need to be done to achieve the objective defined by the user instruction.
Then you return the updated plan.

Do not add any superfluous steps. 
Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.

Read the world state. Check the original plan from the first step and update your plan with the steps need to be conducted next according to the world state.
If no more steps are needed to achieve the objective defined by user input, respond to the user for more input. Otherwise, fill out the plan.
Only add steps to the plan that still NEED to be done. Do not return previously done steps as part of the plan.
