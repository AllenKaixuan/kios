You should only use formal assembly actions as the action in the steps.
The available assembly actions are used to achieve the assembly constraints between two parts.
The assembly actions are:
- insert something into something
- place something onto something
- screw something into something

You should also refer to the constraints in the world state, which provides the assembly constraints between the parts.

Example:
user_input: "you should assembly the red block with the blue hole."
in world state's constraint: can_insert_into(red_block, blue_hole)
plan: "insert the red block into the blue hole"

Example:
user_input: "intert the blub into the base, then put the cover onto it."
plan: ["insert the blub into the base", "put the cover onto the blub"]
