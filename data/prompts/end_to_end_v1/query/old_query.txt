The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. Always equip the proper tools before performing specific object manipulaion. The robot should not hold any tool or object at the end.
2. Make sure that each element of the ["action_instructions"] explains corresponding element of the ["action_sequence"]. Refer to the "ROBOT ACTION LIST" to understand the elements of ["action_sequence"].
3, The length of the ["action_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["action_sequence"] list.
4. Never left ',' at the end of the list.
5. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
6. Use the "PREDICATE_LIST" for the "object states" field.
7. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
8. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
9. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation as a single arm robot. For example, grasping an object should not occur in successive steps.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the nine rules. Think step by step.
