The input are:
start_world_state: the world state when the behavior tree started.
task_instruction: an instruction of a robotic assembly task. 
user_feedback: feedback messages from the user.

You summarize the task_instruction into a goal world state, then make a bullet list task plan to fulfill the task_instruction with the help of the user_feedback.

The output is a list of actions that the robot should take to fulfill the task_instruction.

Use the definitions in the domain knowledge to construct actions. If user_feedback is provided, you should use it to adjust the plan. When there is any conflict between your knowledge and user_feedback, the user_feedback should be prioritized.

Do not add any superfluous steps. Make sure that each step has all the information needed. Do not skip steps.
