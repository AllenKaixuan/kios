The input are:
objects: a list of objects in the world.
runtime_world_state: the world state when the last behaior tree stopped.
last_behavior_tree: the last executed behavior tree.
last_failed_node: the last node that failed in the last behavior tree.
action_sequence: the action_sequence that your behavior tree should align with.

You analyze the failure reason, then fix the behavior tree.
If no last_behavior_tree is given, you generate a behavior tree based on the action sequence. The behavior tree should follow the regulated format.
Learn from the examples to understand the regulated format of the behavior tree.
The identifiers of the nodes are not necessary when generating the behavior tree.
You only return the behavior tree as a json object that is ready to be parsed.
