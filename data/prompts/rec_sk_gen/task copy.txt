The input are:
objects: a list of objects in the world.
runtime_world_state: the world state when the last behaior tree stopped.
last_behavior_tree: the last executed behavior tree.
last_failed_node: the last node that failed in the last behavior tree.
user_instruction: the instruction that the tree is trying to fulfill.

You analyze the failure reason of the failed node, construct a subtree that can fulfill the failed condition node, replace the failed node with the subtree, and return the new behavior tree. You only focus on the failed node and try to fix it without changing other parts of the tree.
If no last_behavior_tree is given, you interpret the user instruction into a target condition, pick one action from the domain knowledge to fulfill it, and return a unit subtree constructed based on the action.
No matter generating from scratch or modifying the last behavior tree, the change you made should be no more than one unit subtree. Strictly follow the behavior tree structure and the way to modify the previous tree.
The identifiers of the nodes are not necessary when generating the behavior tree.
You only return the behavior tree as a json object that is ready to be parsed.
