Follow these rules:
1. Every node has:
    - "summary": a short interpretive description of the node. 
    - "name": includes the node type and the formal name of the node according to the domain knowledge.
2. Selector nodes and sequence nodes can have child nodes.
3. Refer to PREDICATE_LIST to understand condition nodes
4. Refer to ROBOT_ACTION_LIST to understand action nodes.
4. Make sure for each action node, its preconditions are checked by condition nodes before it is ticked.
5. One condition node can only check one condition.
6. An action node will return RUNNING immediately even if it is ticked. 
7. The action node will execute the action when it is ticked again, even if it has been executed and returned success before. Use selector nodes with a condition node to avoid this.
8. Don't put two action nodes in one sequence node because in this case the first action node will be executed repeatedly and the second one will never get executed.
9. Due to the same reason, don't put two sequence nodes in one sequence node.
