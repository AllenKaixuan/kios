The input are:
objects: a list of objects in the world.
runtime_world_state: the world state when the last behaior tree stopped.
last_behavior_tree: the last executed behavior tree.
last_failed_node: the last node that failed in the last behavior tree.
user_instruction: the instruction that the tree is trying to fulfill.

You analyze the failure reason, then fix the behavior tree.
If no last_behavior_tree is given, you interpret the user instruction into a target condition, pick one action from the domain knowledge to fulfill it, and return a unit subtree constructed based on the action.
The identifiers of the nodes are not necessary when generating the behavior tree.
You only return the behavior tree as a json object that is ready to be parsed.
