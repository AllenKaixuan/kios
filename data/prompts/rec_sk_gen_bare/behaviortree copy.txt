The behavior tree should be in json dictionary format.
Follow these rules:
1. Every node are described by a summary and a name:
    - "summary": a short interpretive description of the node. 
    - "name": includes the node type and the formal form of the node according to the domain knowledge.
2. The control flow nodes, namely "selector" and "sequence", can have "children", which is a list of children nodes.
3. The "condition" nodes that are children of "selectors" are targets. Those that are children of "sequences" are preconditions. 
4. All the node always have their corresponding actions/precidates in the domain knowledge. 
5. Control flow nodes in behavior trees don't have memory. Each tick starts from the root and traverses all nodes, regardless of their previous state.
6. The basic structure template of a subtree is:
    - A selector as the root node. 
    - One target condition node as the first child of the selector to check if the target of the action has been fulfilled.
    - A sequence node as the last child of the selector node to achieve the target.
    - A number of precondition nodes as the first children of the sequence node to check the action's preconditions.
    - One action node as the last child of the sequence node, whose preconditions are checked before and will immediate start its action when being ticked.
    - The action should have effects that can fulfill the target condition node in the selector.
7. This is how you generate and use a new subtree:
    - First, find the failed condition node. Refer to runtime world state to understand its failure reason.
    - Find the corresponding action from domain knowledge that can fulfill that condition node.
    - Create a subtree to fulfill that condition node, with that condition node as target node.
    - Create the sequence in this subtree with the action's preconditions and the action.
    - Replace the failed condition node with the subtree in the original tree.
Following is an example of how this works:
old tree: 
{
- selector
    - target
    - sequence
        - precondition1
        - precondition2 (failed according to the runtime world state)
        - action
}
new subtree:
{
- new selector
    - new target (precondition2)
    - new sequence
        - new action's preconditions
        - new action
}
the new behavior tree:
{
- selector
    - target
    - sequence
        - precondition1
        {
            - new selector
            - new target (precondition2)
            - new sequence
                - new action's precondition1
                - new action's precondition2
                - new action
        }
        - action
}
