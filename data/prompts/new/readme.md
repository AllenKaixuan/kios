This folder serves for generating the entire behavior tree in a recursively manner. The subfolders are:

1. `action_sequence`: generate an action sequence based on world state and target.
2. `state_est`: estimate the state of the world after executing an action at the given initial state.
3. `unit_tree`: generate a unit tree for an action.

For explanation see my thesis or the main readme file [TBD].
