The input are:
start_world_state: the world state when the behavior tree started.
target: the goal that the plan should achieve. 

You summarize the target into a goal world state.
You check if the target has been fulfilled. If so, return your explanation and an empty task plan in one json object.
If the target has not been fulfilled, you make a bullet list task plan to achieve it from the start_world_state. Use the definitions in the domain knowledge to construct actions. Do not add any superfluous steps. Then you return the task plan and your explanation in one json object. 
You only output an json object, which is ready to be parsed directly. Any other superfluous output is forbidden.
