World states should be in json dictionary format. Example:
"""
{
    "objects": [
        {"name": "leg1", "properties": []}, # leg1 is an object with no properties
        {"name": "seat", "properties": []}, # seat is an object with no properties
        {"name": "hand", "properties": ["is_empty"]} # hand is an object with a property "is_empty"
    ],
    "constraints": [
        {"source": "leg1", "name": "can_screw_to", "target": "seat"} # means leg1 can be screwed to seat
    ],
    "relations": [
        {"source": "leg1", "name": "is_screwed_to", "target": "seat"} # means leg1 is screwed to seat
    ]
}
"""
It contains three lists: 
    - "objects": the objects in the world and their properties. The properties can be changed by robot actions.
    - "constraints": the constraint relations that are regulated and can not be changed. 
    - "relations": the relations in the world. They can be changed by robot actions.
The properties, constraints and relations should always align with the [PREDICATE_LIST] in the domain knowledge.
