Following is the domain knowledge you need, which includes:
- the instance types in the world,
- the predicates for describing the states of the world,
- the actions that the robot arm can apply.

The instance types are:
"""
object: The object in the world that can be manipulated by <arm>.
arm: The robot arm that can manipulate <object>. A <arm> can only hold one <object> at a time.
location: The language indicated location in the world.
"""

The precidates are:
"""
"PREDICATE_LIST"
- has_reached(<arm>, <object>, <location>): <arm> has reached <object> at <location>.
- is_at(<object>, <location>): <object> is at <location>.
- is_ready(<object>): <object> is ready for some specific actions.
- is_holding(<arm>, <object>): <arm> is holding <object>.
"""

The actions are:
"""
"ROBOT_ACTION_LIST"
- WAIT(<arm>): <arm> waits. An <arm> should always wait if the precondition of the next action is not satisfied.
- REACH(<arm>, <location>): <arm> reach <location>, ready for grasping the object at <location>.
- RETREAT(<arm>): <arm> retreats to a proper position so that the object, which is held by <arm>, is ready to interact with other objects or be further manipulated.
- GRASP(<arm>, <object>): <arm> grasp <object>. As preconditions, <arm> should be holding nothing, and <arm> is supposed to have reached the location where the <object> is. 
- RELEASE(<arm>, <object>): <arm> release <object>.
- POUR(<arm>, <object1>, <object2>): <arm> pours the things in <object1> into <object2>. As preconditions, <object1> and <object2> should be ready.
"""
the items in <> indicate the type of the instances.
