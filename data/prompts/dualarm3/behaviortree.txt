The behavior tree should be in json dictionary format.
Example:
"""
{
    "summary": "selector to insert the gear1 into the shaft1 with the parallel_box1 in the left hand",
    "name": "selector: insert(left_hand, parallel_box1, gear1, shaft1)",
    "children": [
        ...
    ]
}
"""
1. Every node needs at least two keys:
    - "summary": a short interpretive description of the node. 
    - "name": includes the node type and the formal form of the node according to the domain knowledge. Legal node types are "selector", "sequence", "condition" ("target", "precondition"), "action".
2. The control flow nodes, namely "selector" and "sequence", can have the key "children", which is a list of children nodes.
3. The "condition" nodes that are children of "selectors" are targets. Those that are children of "sequences" are preconditions.
4. Use the actions in ROBOT_ACTION_LIST for the action nodes. If condition nodes are needed, use the predicates in PREDICATE_LIST.
