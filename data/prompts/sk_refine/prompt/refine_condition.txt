For condition nodes, you should:
1. refine and add the key "conditions", which is a list of conditions to be checked. Each condition should have the following keys:
    - "object_name": the object to check.
    - "property_name": the property/relation of the object to be checked.
    - "property_value": this should be the other object in the relation. For property it should be null.
    - "status": true if the property/relation is expected to be true, false otherwise.
An example is shown below:
the skeleton:
"""
{
    "summary": "check if left_hand is holding parallel_box1",
    "name": "target: hold(left_hand, parallel_box1)",
}
"""
after refinement:
"""
{
    "summary": "check if left_hand is holding parallel_box1",
    "name": "target: hold(left_hand, parallel_box1)",
    "identifier": 4,
    "type_name": "condition",
    "conditions": [
        {
            "object_name": "left_hand",
            "property_name": "hold",
            "property_value": "parallel_box1",
            "status": true,
        }
    ],
},
"""
