The dictionary that you return should be formatted as json file. Follow these rules:
1. Only refine the skeleton behavior tree in the "behavior_tree" field. Refine the tree according to rules provided before. Replace the old behavior tree with the refined behavior tree.
2. Refer to the domain knowledge, namely "ROBOT_ACTION_LIST" and "PREDICATE_LIST", to understand and refine the skeleton behavior tree.
3. Do not change other fields of the dictionary and return the new dictionary as json file.
4. Never left ',' at the end of the list. 
5. Use json boolean values, "true" or "false", instead of "True" or "False".
6. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
7. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response. Don't write any additional things.
8. When generating the behavior tree, make sure the tree has the asked structure. 
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the rules above. Think step by step.
