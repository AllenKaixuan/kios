Information about world states should be in json dictionary format.
It contains three lists: 
    - objects: the objects and their properties (as lists of strings) in the world. The properties can be changed by robot actions.
    - constraints: the constraint relations that are enforced and should not be changed. They are knowledge about the world or some constraints set by the user.
    - relations: the relations in the world. They can be changed by robot actions.
The properties, constraints and relations should always align with the [PREDICATE_LIST] in domain knowledge.
