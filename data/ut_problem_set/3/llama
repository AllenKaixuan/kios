Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the input you provided, here is the unit subtree for the action "pick_up(left_hand, inwardgripper, chairnut1)" in JSON format:

{
"summary": "Selector to pick up chairnut1 with the left hand using inwardgripper",
"name": "selector: pick_up(left_hand, inwardgripper, chairnut1)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "The target is to hold chairnut1 with the left hand using inwardgripper",
"name": "target: hold(left_hand, inwardgripper, chairnut1)"
},
{
"summary": "Sequence to pick up chairnut1 with the left hand using inwardgripper",
"name": "sequence: pick_up(left_hand, inwardgripper, chairnut1)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the left hand is empty",
"name": "precondition: is_empty(left_hand)"
},
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the inwardgripper is holding chairnut1",
"name": "precondition: hold(inwardgripper, chairnut1)"
},
{
"summary": "Take the action to pick up chairnut1 with the left hand using inwardgripper",
"name": "action: pick_up(left_hand, inwardgripper, chairnut1)"
}
]
}

}
