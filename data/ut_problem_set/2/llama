Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the input you provided, here is the unit subtree for the action "change_tool(left_hand, clampgripper, inwardgripper)" using the domain knowledge you provided:

{
"summary": "Selector to change the tool in the left hand from clampgripper to inwardgripper",
"name": "selector: change_tool(left_hand, clampgripper, inwardgripper)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "The target is to make the left hand hold the inwardgripper",
"name": "target: hold(left_hand, inwardgripper)"
},
{
"summary": "Sequence to change the tool in the left hand from clampgripper to inwardgripper",
"name": "sequence: change_tool(left_hand, clampgripper, inwardgripper)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the left hand is holding the clampgripper",
"name": "precondition: hold(left_hand, clampgripper)"
},
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the clampgripper is empty",
"name": "precondition: is_empty(clampgripper)"
},
{
"summary": "Take the action to change the tool in the left hand from clampgripper to inwardgripper",
"name": "action: change_tool(left_hand, clampgripper, inwardgripper)"
}
]
}
]
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
