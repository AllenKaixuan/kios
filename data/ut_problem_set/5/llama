Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the input you provided, here is the unit subtree for the action "pick_up(left_hand, outwardgripper, lampshade)" using the domain knowledge you provided:

{
"summary": "Selector to pick up the lampshade with the left hand using the outwardgripper",
"name": "selector: pick_up(left_hand, outwardgripper, lampshade)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "The target is to hold the lampshade with the left hand using the outwardgripper",
"name": "target: hold(left_hand, lampshade, outwardgripper)"},
{
"summary": "Sequence to pick up the lampshade with the left hand using the outwardgripper",
"name": "sequence: pick_up(left_hand, outwardgripper, lampshade)",
"children": [
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the left hand is holding the outwardgripper",
"name": "precondition: hold(left_hand, outwardgripper)"},
{
"summary": "A precondition is that the outwardgripper is empty",
"name": "precondition: is_empty(outwardgripper)"},
{
"summary": "Take the action to pick up the lampshade with the left hand using the outwardgripper",
"name": "action: pick_up(left_hand, outwardgripper, lampshade)"}
]
}
]
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
