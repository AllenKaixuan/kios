### About this module

This module utilizes the `unified-planning` package to generate PDDL files, namely domain and problem files, by writing the contents in python.

After a few iterations, blackbird decides to use natural language for problem descption instead of PDDL. One of the reasons is that BB thinks it makes no sense to go back to the "jail" of PDDL, which asks for close-world assumption.

Long story short, this module is *not in use* anymore, but it is still kept in the repository for reference purposes.
