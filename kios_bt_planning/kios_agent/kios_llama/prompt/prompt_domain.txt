Following is the domain knowledge you need, given as a pddl domain file, which includes:
- the types of objects in the world,
- the predicates that can be used to describe the states of the world,
- the actions that you can apply, including their precondtions and effects.

The precidates are explained as follows:
"""
"PREDICATE_LIST"
- is_free(<thing>): <thing> is free and can hold something. (Initially defaulted to be true)
- is_equippable(<tool>): <tool> is ready to be eqquipped by a robot hand. (Initially defaulted to be true)
- can_manipulate(<tool>, <part>): <tool> can be used to manipulate <part> (manipulation constraint) (Initially defaulted to be false)
- can_insert_to(<part1>, <part2>): <part1> can be inserted into <part2> (insertion assembly constraint) (Initially defaulted to be false)
- can_screw_to(<part1>, <part2>): <part1> can be screwed into <part2> (screw assembly constraint) (Initially defaulted to be false)
- can_place_to(<part1>, <part2>): <part1> can be placed into <part2> (placement assembly constraint) (Initially defaulted to be false)
- hold(<thing1>, <thing2>): <thing1> is being held by <thing2> (Initially defaulted to be false)

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
