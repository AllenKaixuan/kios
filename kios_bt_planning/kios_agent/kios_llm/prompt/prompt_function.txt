Necessary and sufficient robot actions are defined as follows:
"""
"ROBOT ACTION LIST"
- load_tool(): Equip the robot hand with a toolbox in order to manipulate some objects later. This action can only be performed when no tool is being equipped.
- unload_tool(): This action can only be performed when a tool is being equipped by the robot hand. The opposite action of load_tool(). 
- move_hand(): Move the robot hand from one position to another with/without grasping an object.
- approach(): Move the robot hand to get close to an object. 
- grasp_object(): Grab an object with robot hand. The robot hand must equips the proper toolbox for manipulating the object.
- release_object(): Release an object in the robot hand when the robot is grasping something. 
- move_object(): Move the object grabbed by the robot hand from one position to another. move_object() is allowed only when the object is not physically constrained by the environment. For example, if the robot hand moves an object on the floor to another location, move_object() is not allowed because the object is constrained by the floor. 
- pick_up(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Move the grabbed object from a state in which it is constrained by a plane to a state in which it is not constrained by any plane. For example, pick_up() is used when a robot hand picks up an object on a table.
- put_down(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of pick_up().
- insert(): This action can only be performed if an object is in hand. Insert the grasped object into a hole of another object.
- screw(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed and has been inserted into the hole. Screw the grabbed object into the hole or onto a bolt-like structure of another obejct. This can only be conducted when the object and the hole has an screw thread assembly constraint.
- adjust_by_rotate(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Rotate an object that is rotationally constrained by its environment along its rotation. For example, when adjusting the temperature of a refrigerator, the temperature knob makes this motion.
- close_by_rotate(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of open_by_rotate().
- open_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Moves an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when opening a sliding door or drawer, the handle makes this movement.
- adjust_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Slide an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when widen the gap between a sliding door and the wall, the handle makes this movement.
- close_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of open_by_slide().
