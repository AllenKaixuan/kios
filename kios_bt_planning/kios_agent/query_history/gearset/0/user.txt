The dictionary that you return should be formatted as json file. Follow these rules:
1. Always equip the proper tools before performing specific object manipulaion.
2. Make sure that each element of the ["action_instructions"] explains corresponding element of the ["action_sequence"]. Refer to the "ROBOT ACTION LIST" to understand the elements of ["action_sequence"].
3, The length of the ["action_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["action_sequence"] list.
4. Never left ',' at the end of the list. Use json boolean values, "true" or "false", instead of "True" or "False".
5. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please make sure you fill out the "objects" section for all listed items. 
6. Use the "PREDICATE_LIST" for the states in the problem.
7. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
8. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
9. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation as a single arm robot. For example, grasping an object should not occur in successive steps.
10. When generating the behavior tree, make sure the tree has the asked structure. 
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the rules above. Think step by step.
