Information about world states are given as json dictionary. Example:
"""
{
    "objects": [
        {"name": "leg1", "properties": []},
        {"name": "seat", "properties": []},
        {"name": "cabinet", "properties": ["open"]},
        {"name": "parallel_box1", "properties": []},
        {"name": "table", "properties": []},
    ],
    "constraints": [
        {"source": "leg1", "name": "can_screw_to", "target": "seat"},
        {"source": "parallel_box1", "name": "can_manipulate", "target": "leg1"},
        {"source": "cabinet", "name": "on_something", "target": "table"},
    ],
    "relations": [
        {"source": "leg1", "name": "is_screwed_to", "target": "seat"},
    ],
}

It contains three lists: 
    - objects are the objects and their properties (as lists of strings) in the environment. The properties can be changed by robot actions.
    - constraints are the relations that are enforced (which are truth knowledge or defined by the user in the current contexts). They are given as a part of the problem and should not be changed.
    - relations are the relations that are observed in the environment. They can be changed by robot actions.
The available properties, constraints and relations can be found in the [PREDICATE_LIST].
You should only concentrate on those objects, constraints and relations that are relevant for the current task.

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
