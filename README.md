# KIOS --- Knowledge-based Intelligent Operation System

This is a project for robot task planning and execution based on langchain agent (langgraph), LLM, behavior tree and robot expert skills.

> BB: I'm now finishing my master thesis and the project is still under development. The LLM planning functionality has been fully tested and the behavior tree executor has also been proven to work well. 

> BB: I'm now concentrating on generating more data and using them for local model finetuning. The finetuned gpt-3.5-turbo model is now the llm model for generating the unit behavior trees in the behavior tree offline expanding loop, while the mistral 7B model finetuned with QLora 4bit in the llama-factory platform can work equivalently as the unit behavior tree generator. More data is being generated by gpt-4 and collected for the next step to finetuning state forecasting models and sequential planning models.

> BB: To save your time, the tutorial part of the project is still unter construction. You may jump to the "something to try" part to see if there are any updates. BB will fill up the tutorial part as soon as possible.

- About the old version: 
The behavior tree executor is implemented based on project BehaviorTree.CPP. See `kios_cpp`.
Some of the components are implemented in python. See `kios_py`.

> BB: For the old version, please check `old_readme.md`. The old version will be archived and will not be updated anymore. 

- About the new version:
The no-ros version, which aims at simplizing the system structure, is now actively developed.
For this part see `kios_bt_planning`.

- About robot interface:
For people who don't have access to mios, you may deploy your own methods to generate robot commands in "mios_task_factory.py" and your own methods to execute the commands in "robot_command.py".

## Intro

KIOS is a robot task planning system developed by BlackBird for his master thesis. The system is currently under development and is not ready for use. 

The system is mainly written in python. The idea is to integrate the LLM (large language model) into the robot task planning system for automatic behaviortree generation and modification.

The LLM is used for generating the task plan in the form of behavior trees based on the provided domain knowledge (prompt engineering or RAG). The APIs for generating, modifying and executing the behavior trees are exposed to the LLM agent. With the feedback from the robot(also the nature language feedbacks from the user), the LLM agent can modify the behavior tree and generate new plans dynamically to finish the robotic assembly tasks.

The usecases are from the siemens robot assembly challenge and the furniture-bench.

## What is KIOS?


## Getting Started

### Requirements

**For the client side:**
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- conan 1.59.0 (conan 2 is not compatible with the project mios)
- linux Realtime kernal. This is the requirement of robot control interface (1000Hz control loop). For walkthrough please check [here](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html#setting-up-the-real-time-kernel).

**For the server side (if you want to try the local inference models):**
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- CUDA 12.1 or higher
- RAM 32GB or higher
- GPU 24GB or higher

### Install

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for the project.

```bash
conda create -n kios python=3.10
conda activate kios
```

1. Install dependency packages.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install graphviz
# install the package kios_bt_planning
cd kios_bt_planning
pip3 install -e .
```

2. (Skip this if you do not need world state visualization) install neo4j.

The application can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver).

After setting up the neo4j server, please change in the neo4j interface in `kios_bt_planning/kios_world` to your pw.


3. Set up the mios (branch = kios) and the franka robot.

4. Install llama.cpp according to the [docs](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-backends). Please aware that you need to enable CUDA backend.

```bash
# in the virtual environment
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" pip install llama-cpp-python
```

> BB: Go to check the project [mios](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ki_fabrik_integration/MIRMI-public/mios) for more information. The docker image's name is "mirmi/mios", but is not compatible with this project. The skills necessary for the robot manipulation in kios are still being actively developed. A new docker image will be released as soon as possible.
